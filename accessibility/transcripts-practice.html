        <h1>How-to Video Transcripts</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Hello! I am going to talk about how to do accessiblity.</p>
        <p>Firstly, most of the content of the this website that I created comes from Web Accessibility Initiative which was lanched in 1997, so, 7 years after the creation of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Secondly, Web accessibilty makes it possible for everybody or almost everybody to use websites, tools, and tecnologies because of the way they are designed an developped.</p>
        <p>For example, in this website, The headings are all in blue, with the same font and at the same place. The structure of the pargraph is the same. There are simple bullets for concise text. The 2 background colors for the bullet paragraphs are to help especially dyslexics as well as simple font.</p>
        <p>I also added transcripts but no captions. it's too long to do. You can see how to do it by following this link.</p>
        <p>Now I will show you in details a tool that allows to check if a webpage is accessible.</p>
        <p>TO do this, I go to the Web Developer free extention. I click on &#34;Tools&#34;, and then, on &#34;Validate Accessibility&#34;. </p>
