        <p class="yellow">On the "Web Accessibililty" webpage</p>
        <p>Hello!<br> Today I I'm going to talk about accessibility.</p>
        <p>Pointing to the navigation bar whenever needed</p> 
        <p>I will start with the historical Context. Next, I will talk about web accessibility. Above all, what is it, in which areasit is found and who benefits from it. Finally, I will introduce the topic of accessibility in web diesign and development.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Web page change- On the page "Historical Context"</p>
        <p>The creator of the World Wivde Web is Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Navigating the page</p>
        <p>He created it in 1990. Then, in 1994, he founded The World Wide Wbe Consortium. Finnaly, In 1997, he officially launched the Web Accessibility Initiative </p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee had web web accissibility in mind from the start. He said&#58;</p>
        <p>&#171;The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.&#187;</p> 
        <p class="yellow">Web page change- On the page "Web Accessibililty"</p>
        <p>What is web accessibility &#63;</p>
        <p>Web accessibility makes it possible for people with disabilities to use websites, tools, and technologies because of the way they are designed and developed. Concretely speaking, each person can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with the Web and contribute to the Web.</p>
        <p>Web accessibility takes place in 6 main areas&#58; auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual.</p>
        <p>Who benefits from web accessibility&#63;</p>
        <p>Can I say everyone at least at some point in their life.</p>
        <p>Of course, web accessibility benefits people with permanent or temporary disabilities, and aging people with changing abilities, but not only. For example, it is also useful for people using devices with small screens, different input modes, or a slow Internet connection.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Web page change- On the page "Design and Develop"</p>
        <p>Now let's talk about accessibility in writing, web design and development.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Showing link</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about each subject, you can click on the corresponding link.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Navigating the page</p>
        <p>There are many ways to make the web accessible as you can see. I would like to emphasize some of them.</p>
        <p class="yellow">pointing the text each time.</p>
        <p>&#45; Create transcripts and captions for multimedia. I will create transcripts for this video.</p>
        <p>&#45; Use headings to convey meaning and structure and keep content clear and concise.</p>
        <p class="yellow">Surfing the page to show it</p>
        <p>That is what I tried to do here. The headings are all in blue, with the same font and at the same place. The structure of the pargraphe is the same. There are simple bullets for concise text. The 2 background colors for the bullet paragraphs are to help especially dyslexics as well as simple font. </p>
        <p>&#45; Create designs for different viewport sizes. Responsive design is very important. We can use media query to do this for example.</p>
        <p>Now I'm going to use an extension called Web Developer to see concretely how to do responsive design on an example and also accessibility in development as it is written in the last part, that is to say &#58;</p>
        <p class="yellow">pointing the text each time in developping part.</p>
        <p>&#45; Identify page language and language changes.</p>
        <p>&#45; Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure.</p>
        <p>&#45; Include alternative text for images.</p>
        <p>And so on.</p>
        <p>We see each other in the second video.</p>
